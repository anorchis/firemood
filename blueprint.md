# Fire Mood Blueprint

## Overview
A minimalist "Fire Mood" web application that provides a relaxing fireplace experience with optimized visual content.

## Features
- **Lightweight Visuals**: Uses `fire.webp` (animated WebP) for a high-quality, lightweight background.
- **Silent Immersion**: Focused purely on the visual experience (audio removed for performance).
- **Smooth Transitions**: "Start Relaxing" button fades out the UI to reveal the full animation.

## Implementation Details
- **HTML**: Simple `<img>` tag structure.
- **CSS**: `object-fit: cover` for responsive background scaling.
- **JS**: Minimal logic to handle the UI fade-out effect.

## Project Status
- Audio features removed to reduce file size.
- Visuals switched to `fire.webp`.
- Ready for deployment.
